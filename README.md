# Lloyds-Banking-Group-Data-Science

# Summary of Project
Completed a job simulation involving customer churn prediction for the Data Science & Analytics team at Lloyds Banking Group

Developed and implemented a predictive model using random forest and other machine learning algorithms, achieving an ROC-AUC score of 0.69

Conducted advanced data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling, utilising Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib

Performed comprehensive model evaluation and tuning, optimising hyperparameters with GridSearchCV, and applied feature importance analysis to derive actionable business insights
